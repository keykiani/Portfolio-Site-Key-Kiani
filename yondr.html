                    <h4>Tools Used:</h4>
                    <span>Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator, Balsamiq, and lots and lots of Slack and Skype</span>

                        <span>
                            In order to understand the problem, you must understand why it is framed as a problem. The further the understanding of the issue, the better to develop target audiences and standing out against your competitors.
                        </span>
                        <h5>Define //</h5>
                        <span>
                            By evaluating the market and gathering user feedback, I can hone the problem into a measurable and real target. To do this, I have to create the definition to base these judgements on: Who is my user and what are
                            they looking for achieve?
                        </span>
                        <h5>Ideate //</h5>
                        <span>
                            After creating a foundation, I begin designing the meat and potatoes by simplifying the process getting to the end goal for the user. Shortening this process is crucial and can be optimized with carefully carved
                            out information architecture and user flows. Both of these mapped out visually onto the sitemap.

                        <span>
                            Having done sitemap, I move onto the wireframes and run sprints to visually draw out what I believe what could help the user achieve their goals. After several adaptations, I moved to creating a working prototype
                            ready for testing.

                        <h5>Design Iteration //</h5>
                        <span>By gathering a lot data and insights from usability testing and feedback, I begin making design iterations and cleaning the overall presentation until I have what I believe to be the MVP.</span>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <span>Scavenger hunts are a lot of fun, however they can also be a lot of set-up. Users cannot be bothered to explore their local areas around them without the motivation of "searching for the hidden gem".</span>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <span>
                By simplifying the creation process and headache of spreading the word, users can be pressed to the lengthy process of making a scavenger hunt and getting people to play it.We plan on creating a interactive playing process
                that takes advantage of the mobile devices' camera and GPS capabilities.

                <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
                <span>
                    As a part of my research, I was tasked with the competitor analysis. Generally with any competitive analysis, I like to dive nose first and see the competitors in action. The general consensus is that scavenger hunts
                    apps are difficult to manage and the market is mostly dominated by Geocaching. So I had to analyze the strongest Geocaching, along with one that approached the game differently altogether, X App. Unfortunately, around
                    this time the pandemic made it nearly impossible for to get an accurate reading on how many people use these apps and how they used them had also taken a shift. These are the facts I had to be mindful of throughout the
                    design process.

            </div>

            <span>
                From these analyses, I could measure up the competition and gauge where they have gaps and apply my design thinking to take advantage to design a product that pressures the users to define the boundaries of what a scavenger
                hunt can be and to what scale.

                <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                <h5>Research Goals</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn how often user will use their phones while hiking.</li>
                    <li>Understand users' relationship with trusting maps on their phones.</li>
                    <li>Learn how often are users outside aimlessly. Why?</li>
                    <li>Understand how open are users to the concept of discovery.</li>
                    <li>Understand what tasks users hope to achieve wile using a scavenger hunt app.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Conclusions</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        People only use their smartphones when they know they will find something that they are looking for. Users are more likely to use an app if there are stakes of gaining bragging rights or something financially
                        interesting like a “Buy one get one free” coupon to a new place.
                    </li>
                    <li>Users have a very shaky confidence in their map comprehension. A good map system will keep the users confidence in your app and will make using an app more enjoyable.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users will usually not aimlessly go someplace. They need a landmark, a north star to follow, per se, so as to say users need a way to store the map information to have a clear pinpoint as to not stray aimlessly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div style="border: 1px solid black;">" I usually stick to my hot spots primarily, and then look for the hidden gems when I have extra time." - Participant #2</div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users are keen to move more aimlessly if the are near local landmarks and if they they are familiar with the local spots.</li>
                    </ul>

                                Discovery is negatively correlated to safety in the eyes of the user. Discovering something means to take a risk, those that the users are not will to make. If there was a method to making users more open to
                                the concept of trying something, they would have to be motivated socially.

                            <li>Users are motivated by friends actions and are more likely to take risks if they are able to earn social credibility.</li>

                    they want. As the design stage progressed and the ideation shifted, so did the target goals.

                    Shifted the focus on the map search, as well as made the active hunt a dashboard issue. Sharing is given a larger role in passing hunts from user to user. All hunts can be found on the map rather by keywords on a search,
                    however this remains an option.

                            After I have my layout decided on, I will transfer them to illustrator since it is the program I am most comfortable and effiecient with. The wireframing and prototyping process is the always my favorite time to
                            make rapid changes and try out the little changes and test them out quickly. I feel like this part lets me discover more about my design process.

                        For example: My early wireframes and low to mid-fid prototypes had a hamburger menu in the top left with everything tagged in it. Later on, I opted to remove it as it wasn't being used in user testing and stole real
                        estate from having an outstanding search bar.

                    <b>Issue:</b>
                    <p>Need a search filter or a category instead of common words.</p>
                    <b>Severity</b>
                    <p>High</p>
                    <b>Evidence:</b>
                    <p>Users expected the associated word to be the first result by title. The search results were an obvious hurdle.</p>
                    <b>Suggested Change: </b>
                    <p>Seperate common keywords into categories instead. Expand a filter into the search menu.</p>

                    <b>Severity</b>
                    <p>High</p>
                    <b>Evidence:</b>
                    <p>Appearence of this screen would jar participants. Placeholder icons made this screeen seem like tic-tac-toe more than an options menu.</p>
                    <b>Suggested Change: </b>
                    <p>Replaced placeholder icons with suitable and add short titles.</p>

                        <b>Issue:</b>
                        <p>Hitting Play is not an obvious way to activate or add a hunt.</p>
                        <b>Severity</b>
                        <p>High</p>
                        <b>Evidence:</b>
                        <p>Two participants were confused on the wording between "Play" in the app and "Add" when given the task to "Add a hunt to your active hunt list"...</p>
                        <b>Suggested Change: </b>
                        <p>Add a bookmark or star icon. Separate active hunts and saved hunts by tabs.</p>

                            One super positive of being able to get your designs tested as much as possible and get feedback as quickly as possible. This meant there was a lot of little changes, in things like sizing or layout, that would
                            make a universal change in user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>This also means I could take advantage of responsive gridding and other design heuristics to design Yondr to feel like a familiar and more realiable mobile app.</p>
