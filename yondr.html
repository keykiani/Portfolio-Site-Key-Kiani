            <h2>Yondr</h2>
            <p>Yondr is aimed at digitizing the scavenger hunt experience into a simple mobile app. Inspired by board game design and photographyâ€” giving the user a clear goal and the open expression of interpretation. </p>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <div>
              <h4>My Role:</h4>
              <span>User Research, UX Design, UI Design</span>
              <h4>Tools Used:</h4>
              <span>Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator, Balsamiq, and lots and lots of Slack and Skype</span>
              <h4>Process:</h4>
              <h5>Research //</h5>
              <span>In order to understand the problem, you must understand why it is framed as a problem. The further the understanding of the issue, the better to develop target audiences and standing out against your competitors.</span>
              <h5>Define //</h5>
              <span>By evaluating the market and gathering user feedback, I can hone the problem into a measurable and real target. To do this, I have to create the definition to base these judgements on: Who is my user and what are they looking for achieve?</span>
              <h5>Ideate //</h5>
              <span>After creating a foundation, I begin designing the meat and potatoes by simplifying the process getting to the end goal for the user. Shortening this process is crucial and can be optimized with carefully carved out information architecture and user flows. Both of these mapped out visually onto the sitemap.</span>
              <h5>Wireframing & Prototyping //</h5>
              <span>Having done sitemap, I move onto the wireframes and run sprints to visually draw out what I believe what could help the user achieve their goals. After several adaptations, I moved to creating a working prototype ready for testing.</span>
              <h5>Usability Testing //</h5>
              <span>Usability testing and preference testing with as many users I could fit into schedule. I evaluate the pain points and measure the users success rate and time for design process efficiency. </span>
              <h5>Design Iteration //</h5>
              <span>By gathering a lot data and insights from usability testing and feedback, I begin making design iterations and cleaning the overall presentation until I have what I believe to be the MVP.</span>

              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <span>Scavenger hunts are a lot of fun, however they can also be a lot of set-up. Users cannot be bothered to explore their local areas around them without the motivation of "searching for the hidden gem".</span>
              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <span>By simplifying the creation process and headache of spreading the word, users can be pressed to the lengthy process of making a scavenger hunt and getting people to play it.We plan on creating a interactive playing process that takes advantage of the mobile devices' camera and GPS capabilities. </span>
